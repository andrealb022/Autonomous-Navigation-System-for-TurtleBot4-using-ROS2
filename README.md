# Autonomous-Navigation-System-for-TurtleBot4-using-ROS2
A modular ROS2-based software architecture for TurtleBot4, integrating perception, localization, path planning, and navigation. The system leverages an OAK-D PRO camera with YOLOv8 for cone detection, AMCL for localization, and Nav2 with A* planning to achieve reliable autonomous indoor navigation in dynamic environments.
